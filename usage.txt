1. Ensure python is installed on your machine in order to execute the 2 files.
    - This can be done via this website https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Start the server using py server.py

3. Start the client(s) using py client.py, this will automatically connect to the server assuming the server is running
    - For more clients, open a new terminal instance and run the same command py client.py

4. To send messages as a client, just type in the terminal window and hit enter to send your message, this will broadcast to all other clients along with their address information (IP address, PortNum)

5. To close a client instance, type QUIT and hit enter in the client instance you wish to close. Server will recognize and remove the client, this message will not be broadcasted.

6. To close the server instance, close the terminal window.
